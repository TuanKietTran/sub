## Checklist

- [ ] Follows the three-export handler pattern (`create*Handler`, `*Command`/`*Query`, `register*`) if a handler was added

- [ ] New deploy strategies are registered in `infra/deploy/index.ts`
- [ ] New API routes use the correct Nitro filename convention (`<name>.<method>.ts`)
- [ ] `infra/registry.ts` updated if new handlers were added
- [ ] No `@infra` or `@core` imports introduced in the wrong direction (core must not import infra)
